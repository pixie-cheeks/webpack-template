# Webpack Template

A webpack template repo for VanillaJS projects. This will constantly be updated
as I gain more knowledge and become more capable in general.

## Important Traits

- Uses pnpm
- Uses stylelint with a BEM-compliant config
- Uses eslint with the airbnb-base config and a few personal modifications
- Almost all js files are in ES6 except for the `eslintrc.cjs`
